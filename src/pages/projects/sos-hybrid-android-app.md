The "Save A Neighbour's Soul" (SANS) project involved resurrecting an older project of a client and bringing it to life.

React and [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) were used to build the app. 

To make the native android app the React app was wrapped by using [Ionic Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) and building the resultant Android Studio project into the Native app for deployment on Google Play.

[Laravel](https://laravel.com/) was utilised for the API of the project, to facilitate ease and speed of API development.

The [web app version](https://sans-sos.org/) can temporarily be viewed and used until the app goes live on Google Play.
