My client required an existing site built with a custom Wordpress theme to have a visual overhaul and some site map changes.

Using the designer's Photoshop images I re-created the style of the site from scratch as well as any adjustments necessary to the PHP theme files.

I had recently learned about a new CSS methodology called [CUBE CSS](https://piccalil.li/blog/cube-css/ "CUBE CSS") (and I love learning new things) so I tried it in this project and loved how simple it made the CSS.
