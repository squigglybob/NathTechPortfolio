This timer is a pet project that I wanted to make to help me time stretching routines before and after exercise.  I wanted the timer to go through several sections of differing length automatically.

It would be nice if it spoke to you to tell you which timer you were on.

It would also be nice if you could speak to it to pause and play and move forward and backward in the routine.

The app would also flexible enough to use as an exercise timer whether, physical, mental or spiritual.
